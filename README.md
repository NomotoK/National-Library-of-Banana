# National-Library-of-Banana
### 班拿纳群岛共和国国家图书馆

本项目作为班拿纳文化溯源的一部分，旨在对班拿纳悠久的文化历史和遗产进行保护和传承。目前收录由wifi编写的三版《ICU传奇》。本书记载了在班拿纳建国伊始，在四方势力不断的战争和角逐之下诞生的传奇人物田浩克 唐迩仁 萧帝氪 孙王韦等人的故事。正如本书开头所说：

>战争，不知从何时开始。没有善与恶、正与反。有的，只是立场不同。无数年的战争中，数不尽的文明消失，星系湮没。生命在这场波及大半个多元宇宙的战争中是如此的脆弱。
>平凡的角落尚未被波及，小小的河系带着它的群星孤独地旋转。一颗蔚蓝色的小球点缀其中，如此平凡，如此脆弱。


目前为止本仓库还缺失了四卷《蕉人传》，以及《菲奥娜之诗》《班拿纳国家宪法》《班拿纳群岛行政区划地图》各一卷。

### National Library of the Republic of the Banana Islands


This project, as part of the tracing of Banana culture, aims to protect and inherit the long cultural history and heritage of Banana. Currently included are three versions of 'ICU Legend' written by WiFi. This book records the stories of legendary figures such as Tian Hulk, Tang Wanren, Xiao Di Krypton and Sun Wang Wei, who were born at the beginning of the founding of Banana under the constant wars and competitions of the Four Forces. As stated at the beginning of this book:



>No one knows when the war started. When the songs were written, there were no good or evil, no right or wrong, except a different stance. In countless years, countless civilizations have vanished and galaxies have ruined. Life is so fragile in this war that affects >most of the multiverse. In an ordinary corners have not yet been touched, the small Milky Way galaxy is spinning alone with its stars. A blue planet adorns it, so ordinary and fragile.



So far, this repo is missing four volumes of the "Biography of the Banana Man", as well as one volume of the "Poems of Fiona", one volume of the "Banana National Constitution", and one volume of the "Banana Islands Administrative Map".
